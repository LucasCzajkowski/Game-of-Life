# Game-of-Life
An implementation of the Conway's Game of Life in javascript

This is a short project in javascript containing the algorithm for Conway's Game of Life. It uses a canvas for rendering out the grid to the screen. It is not the fastest implementation but it can help you start. The grid loops so when the cell goes to the border of the grid it will be transported to the oposite border.

This repository consists of an .html page a .js file with the implementation and a .css style document.

You can see it in action at: http://ionforcestudio.com/projects/GameOfLife/gameoflife.html
